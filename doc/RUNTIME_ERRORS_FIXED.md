# Runtime Errors Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing export-helper.js Reference

- **Problem**: authors.html was trying to load a non-existent export-helper.js file
- **Solution**: Created the file for backward compatibility and removed the reference from the template

### 2. ValidationModule Not Defined

- **Problem**: Bootstrap was trying to register ValidationModule which wasn't loaded
- **Solution**: Made module registration conditional - only register if module is defined

### 3. BaseModule Core Undefined

- **Problem**: BaseModule methods were trying to use this.core before it was initialized
- **Solution**: Added null checks for this.core in all BaseModule methods

### 4. Data Structure Mismatch

- **Problem**: Frontend expected different data structure than backend provided
- **Solution**: Updated loadInitialData to handle the transformed array structure

### 5. Missing Module Scripts

- **Problem**: ValidationModule and ExportModule scripts weren't included

- **Solution**: Added module script references to authors.html

## Key Changes Made

1. **authors.html**: Removed export-helper.js reference, added validation and export modules
2. **bootstrap.js**: Made module registration conditional with typeof checks
3. **module-registry.js**: Added defensive programming to BaseModule methods
4. **app-clean.js**: Fixed data loading to handle array structure
5. **export-helper.js**: Created for backward compatibility
6. **upcoming.html**: Fixed JSON serialization in script tags
